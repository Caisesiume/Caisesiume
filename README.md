### About me
Hey,

Thanks for taking your time to get to know me a bit better.
I am a 20yr old guy studying software engineering and management at the Univercity of Gothenburg. Programming and software development stared out as a hobby but is now what I do most of my time awake. 

When I'm not working/studying you might find me playing online games with friends or on a bike outdoors in rain. Besides that, I spend a lot of my time on [*Twitch*](https://twitch.tv/), both as a viewer and streamer. I have been playing around alot with their API in a few programming projects. Sadly I just have a initial version of a [Chat Bot](https://github.com/Caisesiume/CaiBot) public on GitHub.
